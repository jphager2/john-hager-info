            This is a Rails application with guest posts and blog post 
            models that was built for my fiancee and my wedding in 
            2014. There is also a simple content managment system that
            allows you to update the pages from the browser.

          <h6 class="subheader">Steak Code</h6>
          <p>
            This is a quick and fun project. The idea is to be able
            to load and edit code in interesting fonts like STEAK.
            Perhaps not very useful, but definitely fun.

          <h6 class="subheader">Mangdown</h6>
          <p>
            This is the first major Ruby project that I worked on. 
            It is a gem that allows you to download manga from the 
            web. There are others like it, in python for example, 
            but it was a great project for learning object oriented 
            programing and using nokogiri.

          <% end %>
          <h6 class="subheader">Gotasku</h6>
          <p>
            Similar to Mangdown, this is uses nokogiri to scrape data
            from from the goproblems.com website and save go problems
            to your computer. It also uses mechanize to let you sign
            in to the site.  I hope to also add a feature for allowing
            users to upload their problems directly from their 
            computer.

          <p>
            Rails-go is a Rails app for the game of Go. It is a bit 
            slow because the game logic is completely implimented in
            the Rails controller. There is almost 0% javascript. I 
            love Ruby, and I really enjoyed building the Go logic.

          <h6 class="subheader">Rails-Chess</h6>
          <p>
            Rails-chess is a Rails app that lets you play chess. 
            The game logic is Ruby, so it is a little slow, but  
            it uses JavaScript to let you chose your move. 
            Chess took a little bit longer to build than Go because
            there are so many more logical moves in Chess. However,
            it was much easier to check if the king is checked
            than it was to get the liberties of a group of stones in
            Go!

          <p>
            Sinatra-go is a simple Sinatra app that uses the same
            go logic as Rails-go, which is my ruby-go gem. This app
            uses websockets to push data to clients. One client can 
            take black, another can take white, and further clients
            can watch the game progress as spectators.
